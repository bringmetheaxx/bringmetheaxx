 _**bringmetheaxx** aka √Åxil Quirino_

Here you'll find all the recent things that I'm doing,<br>
which isn't that much, but stay tuned and I can surprise you!

Currently I am part of the class15 of the [Hack Your Future Belgium.](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium)<br>

I am _bringmetheaxx_ all over the internet so find me! <br> 

I love to talk about pop culture, drag queens, the end of the world,<br>
I love cats and if you don't like cats, maybe it's time to rethink your life<br>
I also love to talk about pop culture, drag queens, the end of the world,<br>
lgbtqia+ rights, books, trashy reality shows and technology.<br>
My favorite things are: cooking, listening to music,<br>
writing and being gay af. <br>
